            Potato casserole that is a favorite in France. It's a specialty from the Savoie (Alps) region.
            Perfect for a cold day--especially after a day on the slopes.

            I use Brie when making it in the U.S. Reblochon cheese is the authentic cheese for the dish, but
            it's impossible to find in the USA. Raclette cheese mixed with Gruyere is also a good substitute.
